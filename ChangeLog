	* Numerous fixes rolled into update compilation across updated
	platforms

1999-09-12  Paul Robert Hayes  <prh@cemtach.com>

	* Added a 2D example case08 untested, noticed a problem in PNM
	output code which will cause problems, needs a rewrite.

	* Moved initial file stuff into main and out of userOutput
	routines which avoids the recheck every time output occurs.

	* Fixed a few typo bugs

	* Problems with timing on some machines addressed hopefully with
	configure and compiler defines.  It should use any and all timing
	capabilities available to it which gives a robust timing
	mechanism.  Note that clock_gettime is more representative of wall
	clock simulation time and thus may vary greatly if you are running
	other things at the same time.  If almost nothing else consumes
	CPU time, then clock_gettime and times/clock should mostly agree.

	* Reworking the test directory and GNU configure/make scripts is
	getting closer to usable functionality.

	* Improved logfile a bit.

	* Automatic removal of all old simulation files as the simulation
	begins which is necessary when many output files are opened as
	append.

	* More configuration work even though it's a bit of overkill now,
	the utility should pan out as different machines are used and more
	functionality is added.

	* All code should include config.h first as it is configure to the
	system by configure.  System includes come after that based on
	ifdef per system irregularity and local code includes come last.

	* Added wr90 waveguide example.

	* Fixing timing to work at top level.

1999-09-06  Paul Robert Hayes  <prh@cemtach.com>

	* Conversion to a GNU configure and make structure begins.

	* Started adding more debugging/checking to parseFile and main.

	* Added maximumSimulationTime as a control quantity which is a bit
	more direct when comparing to input stimuli.  This will override
	any previously or not set maximumIteration values.

	* Functional version came online.  Simple typos had been the
	problem.  Going ahead with a 0.1 release keeping in mind that it
	isn't fully implemented or documented, yet this will give an idea
	of where the code is going.

	* Broke out the directories a bit so the src and test files were
	easier to manage started adding in the canoniocal tests and
	documenting what they test.  This could take a while....  However,
	it gives a valuable set of examples in the input language and also
	rigorously tests the separate pieces of the code.

1999-08-25  Paul Robert Hayes  <prh@cemtach.com>

	* Only generating minimal input checking for now, once the code is
	running more thoroughly, more time can be spent in user input
	checking.

	* Testing began in earnest, some cases work, others don't adding
	input and output styles as I go.  Each needs debugging, probably
	some typos.

1999-08-23  Paul Robert Hayes  <prh@cemtach.com>

	* Leaving input language mostly identical to original code in 0.1
	version to give a `talking point' about input languages.

	* Creation.  Okay, not really, but the `porting' of my old TLM
	code originally written circa 1989-92 into a Pulse code.  This
	means adding more documention and a rewrite based on the coding
	tricks I've learned since then.
