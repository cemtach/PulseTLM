Changes since 0.2.2

The input language has been changed to be case insensitive.

The build system has been converted to use the GNU toolchains
so that

configure && make

should just work on most systems.  It has been tested on
more platforms.

The tests should work in the Bourne and C shells now.

Diagnostic messages have been added for more failure cases.
Hopefully if things go wrong, it will now be clearer as to
why.

Work has started on a Unix-style manual page.

The code has been modified to improve readability and,
hopefully, maintainability.

Kudos to the diligent work of Hugh Sasse!

Enjoy
